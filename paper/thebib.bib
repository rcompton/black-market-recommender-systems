abstract = {Despite continuous hardware advances, MRI is frequently subject to field perturbations that are of higher than first order in space and thus violate the traditional k-space picture of spatial encoding. Sources of higher order perturbations include eddy currents, concomitant fields, thermal drifts, and imperfections of higher order shim systems. In conventional MRI with Fourier reconstruction, they give rise to geometric distortions, blurring, artifacts, and error in quantitative data. This work describes an alternative approach in which the entire field evolution, including higher order effects, is accounted for by viewing image reconstruction as a generic inverse problem. The relevant field evolutions are measured with a third-order NMR field camera. Algebraic reconstruction is then formulated such as to jointly minimize artifacts and noise in the resulting image. It is solved by an iterative conjugate-gradient algorithm that uses explicit matrix-vector multiplication to accommodate arbitrary net encoding. The feasibility and benefits of this approach are demonstrated by examples of diffusion imaging. In a phantom study, it is shown that higher order reconstruction largely overcomes variable image distortions that diffusion gradients induce in EPI data. In vivo experiments then demonstrate that the resulting geometric consistency permits straightforward tensor analysis without coregistration. Magn Reson Med, 2011. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

@article{Schultz2010,
abstract = {A basic framework for image reconstruction from spatial encoding by curvilinear, nonbijective magnetic encoding fields in combination with multiple receivers is presented. The theory was developed in the context of the recently introduced parallel imaging technique using localized gradients (PatLoc) approach. In this new imaging modality, the linear gradient fields are generalized to arbitrarily shaped, nonbijective spatial encoding magnetic fields, which lead to ambiguous encoding. Ambiguities are resolved by adaptation of concepts developed for parallel imaging. Based on theoretical considerations, a practical algorithm for Cartesian trajectories is derived in the case that the conventional gradient coils are replaced by coils for PatLoc. The reconstruction method extends Cartesian sensitivity encoding (SENSE) reconstruction with an additional voxelwise intensity-correction step. Spatially varying resolution, signal-to-noise ratio, and truncation artifacts are described and analyzed. Theoretical considerations are validated by two-dimensional simulations based on multipolar encoding fields and they are confirmed by applying the reconstruction algorithm to initial experimental data.

@article{Reeder2005,
abstract = {Chemical shift based methods are often used to achieve uniform water-fat separation that is insensitive to Bo inhomogeneities. Many spin-echo (SE) or fast SE (FSE) approaches acquire three echoes shifted symmetrically about the SE, creating time-dependent phase shifts caused by water-fat chemical shift. This work demonstrates that symmetrically acquired echoes cause artifacts that degrade image quality. According to theory, the noise performance of any water-fat separation method is dependent on the proportion of water and fat within a voxel, and the position of echoes relative to the SE. To address this problem, we propose a method termed "iterative decomposition of water and fat with echo asymmetric and least-squares estimation" (IDEAL). This technique combines asymmetrically acquired echoes with an iterative least-squares decomposition algorithm to maximize noise performance. Theoretical calculations predict that the optimal echo combination occurs when the relative phase of the echoes is separated by 2pi/3, with the middle echo centered at pi/2+pik (k=any integer), i.e., (-pi/6+pik, pi/2+pik, 7pi/6+pik). Only with these echo combinations can noise performance reach the maximum possible and be independent of the proportion of water and fat. Close agreement between theoretical and experimental results obtained from an oil-water phantom was observed, demonstrating that the iterative least-squares decomposition method is an efficient estimator.},

abstract = {A scheme enabling the acquisition of high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra within inhomogeneous magnetic fields is introduced and exemplified. The scheme is based on the spatial encoding protocol recently introduced for collecting multidimensional NMR data within a single scan, which retrieves spectral information via interference phenomena between spin packets located at distinct positions within the sample. This in turn enables compensating for field inhomogeneities over the sample as a whole by shifting the phases of the radio-frequency pulses involved in the spatial encoding, rather than by demanding an extreme uniformity in the employed magnetic field. The upper tolerable field inhomogeneity limit thus becomes orders of magnitude higher than that in conventional time-domain acquisitions. No particular spatial dependencies are demanded by the new scheme, which can yield its high-resolution results on a single-scan basis.},

It is shown that a sharp definition for the charge of molecular fragments emerges from PT and that the ensuing population analysis can be used to study how charge redistributes during dissociation and the implications of that redistribution for the dipole moment. Interpreting small differences between the isolated parts' ionization potentials as due to environmental inhomogeneities, we gain insight into how electron localization takes place in H2(+) as the molecule dissociates. Furthermore, by studying the preservation of the shapes of the parts as different parameters of the model are varied, we address the issue of transferability of the parts. We find good transferability within the chemically meaningful parameter regime, raising hopes that PT will prove useful in chemical applications.},

abstract = {Spin relaxation is a sensitive probe of molecular structure and dynamics. Correlation of relaxation time constants, such as T(1) and T(2), conceptually similar to the conventional multidimensional spectroscopy, have been difficult to determine primarily due to the absense of an efficient multidimensional Laplace inversion program. We demonstrate the use of a novel computer algorithm for fast two-dimensional inverse Laplace transformation to obtain T(1)--T(2) correlation functions. The algorithm efficiently performs a least-squares fit on two-dimensional data with a nonnegativity constraint. We use a regularization method to find a balance between the residual fitting errors and the known noise amplitude, thus producing a result that is found to be stable in the presence of noise. This algorithm can be extended to include functional forms other than exponential kernels. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithm at different signal-to-noise ratios and with different T(1)--T(2) spectral characteristics using several brine-saturated rock samples.},

A zeroth-order regularization functional is used to incorporate a priori information about the smoothness of the parameters into the problem formulation. We adapt the Butler-Reeds-Dawson (1981) algorithm to solve this optimization problem in three steps. In the first step, the data are compressed using singular value decomposition (SVD) of the kernels. The tensor-product structure of the kernel is exploited so that the compressed data is typically a thousand fold smaller than the original data. This size reduction is crucial for fast optimization. In the second step, the constrained optimization problem is transformed to an unconstrained optimization problem in the compressed data space. In the third step, a suboptimal value of the smoothing parameter is chosen by the BRD method. Steps 2 and 3 are iterated until convergence of the algorithm. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithm on simulated data},

abstract = {A way to use adiabatic radiofrequency pulses and modulated magnetic-field gradient pulses, together constituting a "shim pulse," for NMR spectroscopy and imaging is demonstrated. These pulses capitalize on phase shifts derived from probe gradient coils to compensate for nonlinear intrinsic main magnetic field homogeneity for spectroscopy, as well as for deviations from linear gradients for imaging. This approach opens up the possibility of exploiting cheaper, less-than-perfect magnets and gradient coils for NMR applications.},

abstract = {Recent improvements in parallel imaging have been driven by the use of greater numbers of independent surface coils placed so as to minimize aliasing along the phase-encode direction(s). However, gains from increasing the number of coils diminish as coil coupling problems begin to dominate and the ratio of acceleration gain to expense for multiple receiver chains becomes prohibitive. In this work, we redesign the spatial-encoding strategy in order to gain efficiency, achieving a gradient encoding scheme that is complementary to the spatial encoding provided by the receiver coils. This approach leads to "O-space" imaging, wherein the gradient shapes are tailored to an existing surface coil array, making more efficient use of the spatial information contained in the coil profiles. In its simplest form, for each acquired echo the Z2 spherical harmonic is used to project the object onto sets of concentric rings, while the X and Y gradients are used to offset this projection within the imaging plane. The theory is presented, an algorithm is introduced for image reconstruction, and simulations reveal that O-space encoding achieves high encoding efficiency compared to sensitivity encoding (SENSE) radial k-space trajectories, and parallel imaging technique with localized gradients (PatLoc), suggesting that O-space imaging holds great potential for accelerated scanning.},

The nanoconstruct consists of ferromagnetic (Co) particles coated with gold (Au) for biocompatibility and a unique shape that enables optical absorption over a broad range of frequencies. The end result is a dual-modality probe useful for the detection of trace amounts of nanoparticles in biological tissues, in which MRI provides volume detection, whereas PAT performs edge detection.},

@article{Lustig2007,
abstract = {The sparsity which is implicit in MR images is exploited to significantly undersample k-space. Some MR images such as angiograms are already sparse in the pixel representation; other, more complicated images have a sparse representation in some transform domain-for example, in terms of spatial finite-differences or their wavelet coefficients. According to the recently developed mathematical theory of compressed-sensing, images with a sparse representation can be recovered from randomly undersampled k-space data, provided an appropriate nonlinear recovery scheme is used. Intuitively, artifacts due to random undersampling add as noise-like interference. In the sparse transform domain the significant coefficients stand out above the interference. A nonlinear thresholding scheme can recover the sparse coefficients, effectively recovering the image itself. In this article, practical incoherent undersampling schemes are developed and analyzed by means of their aliasing interference. Incoherence is introduced by pseudo-random variable-density undersampling of phase-encodes. The reconstruction is performed by minimizing the l(1) norm of a transformed image, subject to data fidelity constraints. Examples demonstrate improved spatial resolution and accelerated acquisition for multislice fast spin-echo brain imaging and 3D contrast enhanced angiography.},
